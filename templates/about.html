      <h3>Project overview and approach</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          This project represents my final product after several earlier
          attempts. Although those versions did not result in a finished
          application, they clarified that my main challenges were not related
          to technical understanding, but to structure, scope control, and
          maintaining discipline as complexity increased.
        </p>

        <p>
          Earlier attempts became too complex too quickly, with features added
          before the underlying concepts were fully understood. Long breaks
          between work sessions made unfinished code difficult to return to, and
          refactoring often felt overwhelming. These experiences highlighted the
          need for a more deliberate and structured approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the final iteration, I changed strategy before writing code by
          creating a step-by-step MVP roadmap. Dividing the project into small,
          testable phases with clear goals helped prevent scope creep and made
          progress more manageable. I used AI as a learning aid rather than a
          source of solutions, treating moments where code worked without being
          fully understood as signals to revisit the underlying concepts. This
          focus on understanding before implementation supported more confident
          incremental development.

      <h3>Backend focus over polish</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          Coming from a background in frontend development and design, visual
          work is an area where I feel confident. For this project, I made a
          conscious decision to limit frontend polish and instead prioritize
          backend learning. I implemented a clean and functional design using
          CSS variables and Material Icons, and then intentionally stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although further visual refinement would have been comfortable, it
          would not have contributed meaningfully to the learning goals of a
          backend-focused course. Choosing a "good enough" solution allowed me
          to focus on areas where I needed more practice, such as routing,
          database queries, sessions, and security-related considerations.
        </p>

      <h3>Working under constraints</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          Unexpected circumstances, including periods of illness and family
          responsibilities, significantly reduced the time available compared to
          my initial plans. This made it clear that my original time estimates
          were optimistic and based on ideal conditions. As a result,
          prioritization became unavoidable rather than optional.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this context, the MVP roadmap proved especially valuable. Limited
          and unpredictable time forced clearer decisions about what was
          essential and what could be postponed, showing how time pressure
          directly shapes technical and design choices. Rather than abandoning
          the plan, I learned to adapt it, reinforcing the importance of
          flexible and realistic planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working incrementally supported this approach. Breaking features into
          small, testable units that could be completed and committed in single
          sessions reduced cognitive overload and made issues easier to identify
          early. Using Git branches during larger changes provided a safe way to
          experiment as complexity increased, demonstrating how version control
          supports both learning and risk management.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the application grew, keeping most logic in a single
          <code>app.py</code> file became harder to reason about. While
          refactoring into separate modules earlier would have been preferable,
          attempting this late in the project felt risky and time-consuming.
          Instead, I improved internal structure by adding clearer section
          headings and a table of contents within the file. Although this did
          not replace proper modularization, it improved readability and
          maintainability, reflecting a conscious trade-off between ideal
          architecture and practical constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          Early in the project, I also felt uncomfortable using the terminal and
          relied mostly on graphical tools. By deliberately using the integrated
          terminal in VS Code for essential tasks, this gradually became a
          natural part of my workflow.
        </p>

    <section class="journal-section">
      <h3>Using AI responsibly</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          AI support was intentionally constrained throughout the project. I
          defined the current project phase before asking for help and avoided
          implementing any code I could not explain or test independently. This
          helped maintain a strong connection between learning and
          implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used AI to assist with repetitive tasks and structural improvements
          in areas where I already had more experience, particularly
          frontend-related work such as organising CSS. Because I was
          comfortable reviewing the output, this felt like a low-risk and
          effective use of AI. In contrast, I deliberately avoided using AI to
          restructure core backend files such as <code>app.py</code>, as I was
          concerned about breaking existing functionality and reducing my own
          learning. This distinction helped clarify when AI use supports
          understanding and when it risks replacing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the main development work was complete and during a final
          review, I discovered that reorganising my CSS with AI assistance had
          removed some existing code. Being able to restore this by comparing
          earlier commits reinforced the importance of version control and
          careful review when using automated tools.
        </p>

    <section class="journal-section">
      <h3>Testing and confidence</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          Writing automated tests changed how I thought about correctness and
          confidence in my code. While much of the application appeared to work
          through manual testing, writing tests revealed edge cases and an
          existing bug that would likely have caused runtime errors in
          production. This showed that testing is not only about verifying
          expected behaviour, but about uncovering hidden assumptions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Test coverage also made it easier to make changes without fear of
          breaking existing functionality, reinforcing the value of testing as
          part of a professional backend workflow, particularly when working
          incrementally and under time constraints.

    <section class="journal-section">
      <h3>Security considerations</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          Security considerations were integrated throughout the project.
          Database interactions use parameterized queries to reduce the risk of
          SQL injection, and Jinja2's automatic escaping helps protect against
          XSS attacks, which I verified through simple testing. Sensitive
          credentials are handled using environment variables and kept out of
          version control. Together, these choices reflect a growing awareness
          of backend security as an integral part of application design, rather
          than something added after functionality is complete.

      <h3>Reflection and relevance</h3>

      <div class="journal-content">
        <p>
          This project strengthened my understanding of core backend concepts
          while also developing practical technical skills. More broadly, it
          reinforced competencies related to ethical tool use, self-directed
          learning, and scope management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although my long-term goal is not to become a professional developer,
          gaining hands-on backend experience was essential for building the
          technical understanding needed to collaborate effectively with
          development teams and make informed decisions in project or
          coordination roles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the project showed me that successful backend development
          depends on planning, prioritization, and self-regulation as much as
          writing code. Experiencing steady progress and deeper understanding
          made the learning process both motivating and rewarding, and
          strengthened my confidence when working with technical systems.
